# 100 Days of CSS

This is a really fun, very challenging set of mini CSS exercises. They get into interesting colors, animations, positioning, etc.

Heads up: these are **very spicy**! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Instructions

Find 3 different challenges to try! 

[Day One is here.](https://100dayscss.com/?dayIndex=1)

You can navigate to other exercises by using the `<<` and `>>` buttons on the very far left side of the screen.

When you find an exercise you like, on the **right hand size** of the screen, click the button that says "Open Template", fork the CodePen, and try it out! 

Pro tips: don't look at hints! Struggle through it, work with a mentor, look up documentation.

## Additional Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - a GREAT site with really good articles; just SEARCH for things like "flexbox" and "grid"
