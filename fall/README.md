# Fall Break Exercises

For each category, challenges are ordered by level of difficulty - least difficult first, more difficult last. We encourage you to work on a challenge from at least two categories.

## Submission Directions

No matter which challenges or combinations of challenges you choose to tackle, everyone will submit the link to **one** GitHub gist containing links to all of your work. A thread in the cohort slack channel will be pinned to the channel, please drop the link to your gist there by 4pm Sunday, December 1.
