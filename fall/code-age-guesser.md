## JavaScript Code Challenge: Age Guesser

This will give you practice with arguments and parameters, interpolation, and a common challenge - generating random numbers.

## Instructions

### Step 1:

* Declare a global variable, `correctAge` and set it to your age (or any number!)
* Declare a function called `guessAge`. This function should:
  - accept 1 argument, a Number
  - return a String, either "You guessed <parameter>? I'm not that old!" if the argument passed in was greater than `correctAge`, or "You guessed <parameter>? Hahaha!" if the argument passed in was less than `correctAge`. If the argument matches `correctAge`, return "WOW, great guess. What are the odds?"
* Invoke the function several times, passing it a different argument each time to ensure that all three cases are covered correctly.

### Step 2:

* Instead of hard-coding the argument you are passing in, write some JavaScript to generate a random number between 1-100, and pass that in as the argument.

## Additional Resources

You will likely have an idea in your head about how to generate a random number, and also likely to need to Google for help - that's part of your job as a dev! There are several routes you can take. Keep in mind - you won't learn anything from copying and pasting, so play around with whatever examples you find and try to understand how it is working.
