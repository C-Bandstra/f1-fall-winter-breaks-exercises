# Code Tidbits

Samantha Ming puts out weekly content on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the console! She's also great to [follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/samantha_ming).

Her Code Tidbits are very tiny, very fun, and super informative!

## Instructions

The Code Tidbits can be found here: [https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits](https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits)

You can filter the tidbits by category: `JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Console`

Read any 5 tidbits.

In a gist, for each tidbit you read:

- add a link to the specific tidbit
- write up a short paragraph on each detailing what you learned and how you hope to use your new knowledge in the future!

## Deliverable

In your submission gist, add a link to the gist where you wrote up your summaries.

Add your submission gist to the thread in your cohort channel!
