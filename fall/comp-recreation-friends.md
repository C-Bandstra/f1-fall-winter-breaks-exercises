## Comp Recreation: Friends

Hone your HTML annd CSS layout skills by recreating a small section of a site.

## Instructions

Write HTML and CSS to recreate the layout of the comp below. The entire screenshot should take up about 1/3 of your page.

BONUS: When each image is hovered over, can you add some effect so it's very obvious to your user that it's being hovered over? Have some fun and do some research on what makes a good hover state. (This is optional.)

## Deliverable

Complete this challenge **in a CodePen**. Provide the link in your submission gist.

## Comp

**Font:** Choose your own! If you don't want to make decisions, `sans-serif` is absolutely sufficient.

**Colors:**
- Background color of labels over images: `#5E68B0`

NOTE: The background for these labels is not solid. You'll have to do some research to find out how to make it slightly transparent!
