## JavaScript DOM Challenge: Dark Mode

Not only do you get to build out a popular feature that is used on many applications, this challenge will give you some practice handling the ever-so-frequent button click! The fun thing about this one is, while it's a small piece of functionality, there are endless possibilities for how you implement it and what you could add on to it!

## Instructions

Build an app that meets the criteria of the following user stories. A giphy of an example is shown below. You can add as much or as little "jazz" as you'd like; and your app does not have to look like the example, just behave like it.

```
As a user,
- When I load the page I see a light-colored background and two buttons 
- The text on the buttons say "Light Mode" and "Dark Mode"
```

```
As a user,
- When I click the "Dark Mode" button,
- The background color changes to a dark color
```

```
As a user,
- When I click the "Dark Mode" button,
- The I click the "Light Mode" button
- The background color changes back to the light color
```

## Optional Extension

To prevent your program from doing unneccesary work, add in the following:

```
As a user,
- When I am in "Light Mode",
- The "Light Mode" button is disabled
```

```
As a user, 
- When I am in "Dark Mode",
- The "Dark Mode" button is disabled
```

When a button is disabled, you are responsible for two things as a developer:
- Make it appear to be disabled.
- Make it actually disabled - nothing should fire in the event that a user does decide to click on it.

## Deliverable

Complete this challenge in a CodePen. Submit the link to that CodePen in the Google Form provided in the cohort channel.

## Example

Again, this is just an example to illustrate the functionality. This also changes the colors of the buttons which is not required. You can add as much or as little as you'd like - the main goal is the base functionality!
