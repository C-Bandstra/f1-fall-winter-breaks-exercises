## JavaScript DOM Challenge: Greeting App

For this challenge, you can either:
- start with the [Greeting App Comp Recreation](https://github.com/turingschool/f1-fall-winter-breaks-exercises/blob/master/fall/comp-recreation-greeting-app.md) and build off of that
- not worry about the look of this app, and write the HTML, but little to no CSS

## Instructions

Your task is to build a small app that greets any user who enters their name. Your app should meet the criteria of the following user stories.

```
As a user,
- When I load the page,
- I see a header, directions, input field and button.
```

```
As a user, 
- When I type my name into the input field,
- Then click the "Greet Me!" button,
- I should see "Hello, <my name>!" appear below the button
```

```
As a user,
- When I type my name into the input field,
- Then click the "Greet Me!" button,
- The input field should now be cleared out
```

```
As a user,
- Before I type anything into the input field,
- The color of the "Greet Me!" button indicates it is disabled
- and if I try to click the "Greet Me!" button, nothing happens
```

```
As a user,
- When I click the "Greet Me!" button and nothing is in the input field,
- Nothing happens
```
