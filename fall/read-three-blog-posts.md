# Read Three Blog Posts

A resource that many developers use to learn new concepts is blog posts written by other developers! In them, people often share stories of their own experiences learning to understand a new concept, technology, etc.

## Instructions

Choose some (tech) topic that you are interested in learning more about.

Suggestions:

- CSS floats
- semantic HTML
- primitive JavaScript data types
- CSS box sizing (and border box)
- CSS box model
- HTML attributes
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- how JavaScript variables and functions are allocated in memory
- zshell (the new terminal that the recent MacOS update switched to using!)
- anything else that interests you!

Find THREE blog posts written by three different authors about the SAME topic!

## Deliverable

In a gist, write up a summary:

1. What did you learn?
2. How did each author approach the subject?
3. Did they disagree?
4. Did any make more sense to you than the others? Why?

Include a link to your summary gist in the submission gist.
