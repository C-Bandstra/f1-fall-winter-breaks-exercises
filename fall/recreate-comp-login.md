## Comp Recreation: Login Form

Hone your HTML annd CSS skills by recreating a standard login form that you've probably interacted with on countless sites. This will give you practice paying close attention to margin, padding, and border radius. Links are provided to a few go-to resources, as well. Have fun!

## Instructions

Write HTML and CSS to recreate the layout of the login form pictured below. The image does not provide context for how large this should be/how much of the page it should take up - you can make that choice. We recommend making it small enough so you can see the full form in the CodePen page (more than anything to make it easier on you/less scrolling!)

## Additional Resources

Grab your own icons. One easy-to-use site is [Flat Icon](flaticon.com).

## Deliverable

Complete this challenge **in a CodePen.** Submit the link to that CodePen in the Google Form provided in the cohort channel.

## Comp

**Font:** [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/?query=open+san&selection.family=Open+Sans) (To import a font in CodePen, you do NOT need to have a head tag with the link tag inside; click the settings icon to the left of the HTML title for that file, then copy and past the link tag for the font into the "Stuff for <head>" input, then click "Save and Close".)

**Colors:** Choose your own. Please choose wisely. [This](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) is a great tool!
