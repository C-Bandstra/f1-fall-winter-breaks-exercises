## Comp Recreation: Login Form

Describe the purpose/benefit of exercise

## Instructions

Write HTML and CSS to recreate the layout of this login form. The image does not provide context for how large this should be/how much of the page it should take up - you can make that choice. We recommend making it small enough so you can see the full form in the CodePen page (more than anything to make it easier on you/less scrolling!)

## Additional Resources

Grab your own icons. One easy-to-use site is flaticon.com

## Deliverable

Complete this challenge **in a CodePen.** Submit the link to that CodePen in the Google Form provided in the cohort channel.
