## JavaScript Code Challenge: SuperFizzBuzz

This exercise will give you some experience with functions, parameters,
and control flow. Additionally it will prep you for a really common interview
question.

## Instructions

### Step 1:

DO NOT use the internet to search for answers to this question, you're only
cheating yourself if you do. Remember, the growth is in the struggle!

### Step 2:

Write a function named `superFizzBuzz`, that takes a single parameter `test`.
Depending what `test` is your function should do the following:
- If it's evenly divisible by 3, 5, and 7 print SuperFizzBuzz
- If it's evenly divisible by 3 and 7 print SuperFizz
- If it's evenly divisible by 5 and 7 print SuperBuzz
- If it's evenly divisible by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
- If it's evenly divisible by 3, print Fizz
- If it's evenly divisible by 5, print Buzz
- If it's evenly divisible by 7, print Super
- Otherwise print just the number

### Step 3:

It's time to use your new function! Write another function that loops through
all the numbers from 1-1000, and invokes your `superFizzBuzz` function. You can
name this new function whatever you like.
